# Formula_1000
The aim of this project is to design from scratch a Formula 1000 racing car using mainly standard components easily founded in the market. The design is guided following the F1000 regulations of 2013 and the UNI and ISO design standards. There are different software used during the project, such as Creo, Solidworks, Catia V5 and Siemens NX as CAD software, Matlab and PyCharm as mathematical solver and Ansys Workbench and Altair HyperWorks as FEA software.
